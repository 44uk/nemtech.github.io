########################
Registering a namespace
########################

The purpose of this guide is to register your own :doc:`namespace <../../concepts/namespace>`.

**********
Background
**********

A namespace is an on-chain unique domain for your assets.

The easiest way to appreciate it is the domain and file analogy on the internet. Imagine that a domain address has to be unique in a root (lowest level).

If one :doc:`account <../../concepts/account>` creates a namespace, that namespace will appear unique in the NEM ecosystem. For example, if one were to create a namespace called ``foo``, a second person cannot create the same namespace.

*************
Prerequisites
*************

- Finish the :doc:`getting started section <../../getting-started/setup-workstation>`
- NEM2-SDK or CLI
- A text editor or IDE
- An account with XEM

Letâ€™s get into some code

A :doc:`namespace <../../concepts/namespace>` is an on-chain unique domain for your assets. The easiest way to appreciate it is the domain and file analogy on the internet. Imagine that a domain address has to be unique in a root (lowest level).

A mosaic is like a file hosted on a domain and represents an asset. Like a website and directory, a mosaic can have the same name as other files on other domains. However,  a namespace + mosaic is always unique, as the root namespace was unique even if the rest of it is not.

Register your namespace, choosing a name you like. One common option is to use your company's or own name.  In this example, we will register a namespace called ``foo``. Let's check if this name is available.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/namespace/CheckingNamespaceExistence.ts
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  22-

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/java/src/test/java/nem2/guides/examples/namespace/CheckingNamespaceExistence.java
        :language: java
        :lines: 34-40

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/namespace/CheckingNamespaceExistence.js
        :language: javascript
        :lines: 23-

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/cli/namespace/CheckingNamespaceExistence.sh
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh

Is the namespace available? Try to register it before someone else does it!

To register a new namespace, announce a :ref:`register namespace transaction<register-namespace-transaction>` with the chosen name and renting duration expressed in blocks.

.. note:: In Catapult, NEM blocks are complete every ``15`` seconds in average.

.. example-code::

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/typescript/namespace/RegisteringANamespace.ts
        :language: typescript
        :lines:  20-
    
    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/java/src/test/java/nem2/guides/examples/namespace/RegisteringANamespace.java
        :language: java
        :lines: 40-59

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/javascript/namespace/RegisteringANamespace.js
        :language: javascript
        :lines: 27-

    .. literalinclude:: ../../resources/examples/cli/namespace/RegisteringANamespace.sh
        :language: bash
        :start-after: #!/bin/sh

What's next?
************

Now that you have registered your namespace, check how you can  :doc:`create mosaics <../mosaic/creating-a-mosaic>`.

When the transaction is confirmed, you will be able to  :doc:`register a subnamespace <registering-a-subnamespace>` following the next guide.
