We love to receiving contributions from our community â€” you! Follow these guidelines to get your flow included in this documentation.

The first step is to export the flow you have created. In Node-RED, select the flow you want to export. Open ``Export > Clipboard`` from the menu (Ctrl-E) and copy the JSON from the dialogue.

We are using |Node-RED-flows-repository| to share our flows.

1. Click ``Add flow``.
2. Give your flow a short, descriptive title and describe what the flow does and how it is used.
3. Paste the JSON flow you want to share.
4. Add the tag ``NEM2``.

After a while, your flow and your GitHub username will be included in this page.
